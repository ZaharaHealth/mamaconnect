### 🌐 Social Platform
Our social platform serves as the beating heart of MamaConnect, offering a space for mothers to connect, share, and learn from one another. Here's how it works:

- **Subcommunities:** Join specialized groups based on different topics related to motherhood. Whether you're seeking advice on breastfeeding, sharing parenting tips, or discussing pregnancy experiences, there's a community for you.
